# Sprint 1 — Personal Reflection
## Key Learning
I learned that every user story should be divided properly into subtasks that meet the acceptance criteria of the story and that tasks can take up to 1 working day each to complete, making it essential to effectively plan due dates and stick to it as best as possible in order to finish the product in time. I also learned that sprint checkpoints and reviews happen mid and post sprint respectively.

## Assumptions That Failed
Communication was the factor that failed in the sprint. Failure to communicate the importance of acceptance criteria and their connection to tasks that make up user stories meant that the development team were not on the same page about what was expected of them and this means that some tasks were at risk of being delayed.

## Behavioural Change
I want to improve the effectiveness communication between team members so that we can completely prohibit any misunderstanding of the outcome expected. The team should be fully prepared before daily scrums so that all members can be updated on the progress achieved by other members and all expectations can be made known. It will be deemed unacceptable to delay tasks due to a member's failure to communicate and blockers or unexpected complications. It will also be held in the highest priority to have tasks done by their due date.

## Professional Growth
I need to learn how to clearly express my thoughts and understanding on the work that is done. I find that even if I have very good understanding on work, I struggle to piece my thoughts together in a way that makes sense to others. I struggle to think on my feet and need to learn how to organize my thoughts before attempting to speak. If I speak without taking a second to think about my sentence structure then my words come out disorganized.
